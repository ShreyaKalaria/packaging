# Vagrant

You can also install the KERN packaging on any modern operating system using
virtualisation. To make your life easier we've created a simple Vagrant
setup for you, which you can use to initialise a virtual environment.

To get started:

 * Install Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/
 * Checkout this git repository on your system (`git clone https://github.com/kernsuite/packaging`)
 * Run `vagrant up` in the vagrant subfolder
 * Run `vagrant ssh` to enter the virtual machine
 * You can install for example meqtrees with `sudo apt-get install meqtrees`
